<p align="center"><strong>Please note:</strong> this is <em>only</em> desktop port of <a href="https://music.yandex.ru" target="_blank">Yandex.Music</a> website.</p>

## The Why

<img width="140px" align="right" src="static/macOS/yamusic_desktop.png" alt="Yandex.Music logo"/>

I love listen music and always want to do it as easy as possible. Concept of Yandex.Music service (web for desktop clients and app for mobile) are great, but not so really.

- First (and most important): my smartphone is always busy with other applications that use headphones (Skype, Zoom, mobile calls and so on).
- Second (and no less important): I, as an active Mac user, got used to native desktop applications for listening to music, for example, iTunes.

Therefore, I was very upset that _Yandex.Music_ does not have a macOS (or Windows/Linux) desktop application... and created this port for official Yandex.Music website! ðŸ˜‰

## Under the hood

Since this is an open source project, you can easily see how it all **actually works**. The code is written with Go (Golang) `1.13.4` and using `Go Modules`. But all magic is done by absolutely awesome [zserge/webview](https://github.com/zserge/webview) module.

<summary>More info about module</summary>

A tiny cross-platform webview library for C/C++/Golang to build modern cross-platform GUIs. Also, there are Rust bindings, Python bindings, Nim bindings, Haskell and C# bindings available.

It supports two-way JavaScript bindings (to call JavaScript from C/C++/Go and to call C/C++/Go from JavaScript).

It uses Cocoa/WebKit on macOS, gtk-webkit2 on Linux and MSHTML (IE10/11) on Windows.
