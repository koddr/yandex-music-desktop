## The Why

<img width="140px" align="right" src="static/macOS/yamusic_desktop.png" alt="Yandex.Music logo"/>

I love listen music ðŸ¥° and always want to do it as easy as possible. Concept of Yandex.Music service (web for desktop clients and app for mobile) are great, **but not so really**.

- **First** (and most important): I would like to always keep application music app _on hand_ while working at Mac/MacBook. Quickly click on the icon in macOS dock, open app, switch to another song and collapse again. At the same time, without opening a browser and not looking for the desired tab with Yandex.Music.
- **Second** (and important too): my smartphone is _always busy_ with other applications that use headphones with mic, like Skype, Zoom, Discord, mobile calls and so on. In order not to run into browser, look for a tab and pause music. Just took off these headphones and put on others!
- **Third** (and no less important): as an active macOS user, I got used to _native desktop apps_ for listening music (for example, built-in Apple iTunes) and place it on side-mode with another apps (like Telegram) on a separate workspace.

Therefore, I was very upset that _Yandex.Music_ does not have a macOS (or Windows/Linux) desktop application... and created this port of the official Yandex.Music website! ðŸ˜‰

## Under the hood

Since this is an open source project, you can easily see how it all **actually works**. The code is written with Go (Golang) `1.13.4` and using `Go Modules`.

<summary>Yandex.Music Desktop source code</summary><br/>

```go
package main

import "github.com/zserge/webview"

func main() {
	// Webview options:
	//  - name: Yandex.Music Desktop
	name := "Yandex.Music Desktop"
	//  - URL to login screen: https://passport.yandex.com/auth?...
	url := "https://passport.yandex.com/auth?origin=music_button-header&retpath=https%3A%2F%2Fmusic.yandex.com%2Fhome"
	//  - sizes: 800x800 px
	width := 800
	height := 800
	//  - resizable: true
	resizable := true

	// Let's open window app with options:
	webview.Open(name, url, width, height, resizable)
}

```

But all magic is done by absolutely awesome [webview](https://github.com/zserge/webview) module by [Serge Zaitsev](https://github.com/zserge).

<details>
<summary>More about webview module</summary><br/>

A tiny cross-platform webview library for C/C++/Golang to build modern cross-platform GUIs. Also, there are Rust bindings, Python bindings, Nim bindings, Haskell and C# bindings available.

It supports two-way JavaScript bindings (to call JavaScript from C/C++/Go and to call C/C++/Go from JavaScript).

It uses Cocoa/WebKit on macOS, gtk-webkit2 on Linux and MSHTML (IE10/11) on Windows.
