### Looking for a similar desktop app for Yandex.Radio?

- üìª [Yandex.Radio Desktop](https://github.com/koddr/yandex-radio-desktop) app

<br/>

## üí≠ The Why?

<img width="140px" align="right" src="static/macOS/yamusic_desktop.png" alt="Yandex.Music logo"/>

I love listen music ü•∞ and always want to do it as easy as possible. Concept of Yandex.Music service (web for desktop clients and app for mobile) are great, **but not so really**.

- **First** (and most important): I would like to always keep application music app _on hand_ while working at Mac/MacBook. Quickly click on the icon in macOS dock, open app, switch to another song and collapse again. At the same time, without opening a browser and not looking for the desired tab with Yandex.Music.
- **Second** (and important too): my smartphone is _always busy_ with other applications that use headphones with mic, like Skype, Zoom, Discord, mobile calls and so on. In order not to run into browser, look for a tab and pause music. Just took off these headphones and put on others!
- **Third** (and no less important): as an active macOS user, I got used to _native desktop apps_ for listening music (for example, built-in Apple iTunes) and place it on side-mode with another apps (like Telegram) on a separate workspace.

Therefore, I was very upset that _Yandex.Music_ does not have a macOS (or Windows/Linux) desktop application... and created this port of the official Yandex.Music website! üòâ

## ‚öôÔ∏è Under the hood

Since this is an open source project, you can easily see how it all **actually works**. The code is written with Go (Golang) `1.11.x` and using `Go Modules`.

<details>
<summary>Yandex.Music Desktop source code</summary><br/>

```go
package main

import "github.com/zserge/webview"

func main() {
	// URL params
	p := "origin=music_button-header&retpath=https%3A%2F%2Fmusic.yandex.com%2Fhome"

	// Init app
	w := webview.New(false)
	defer w.Destroy()

	// Settings
	w.SetTitle("Yandex.Music Desktop")
	w.SetSize(800, 960, webview.HintNone)
	w.Navigate("https://passport.yandex.com/auth?" + p)

	// Run app
	w.Run()
}
```

But all magic is done by absolutely awesome [webview](https://github.com/zserge/webview) module by [Serge Zaitsev](https://github.com/zserge).

<details>
<summary>More about webview module</summary><br/>

A tiny cross-platform webview library for C/C++/Golang to build modern cross-platform GUIs. Also, there are Rust bindings, Python bindings, Nim bindings, Haskell and C# bindings available.

It supports two-way JavaScript bindings (to call JavaScript from C/C++/Go and to call C/C++/Go from JavaScript).

It uses Cocoa/WebKit on macOS, gtk-webkit2 on Linux and MSHTML (IE10/11) on Windows.
